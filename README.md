# Guess the Number Game 

## Overview

This project is a *Guess the Number* game written in Java. The game challenges the player to guess
a random number, providing feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It includes a high
score tracker that saves the best number of guesses it took to win, allowing players to try and beat
their previous scores.

- **Visual Studio Code**
The game was developed using **Visual Studio Code** for writing and testing the code.


## Programming Language:

   - `java.io`: For file handling (to save the high score).
   These libraries were instrumental in generating the random number and managing file input/output.

## Future work

Several improvements are planned for the future:
- Input Validation: Ensure players can only input valid numbers.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Create a simple graphical interface to enhance interactivity.
- Timer Feature: Track how fast players can guess the number.
- Multiple Rounds: Allow players to play multiple rounds with scores saved between rounds.
- Difficulty Levels: Implement modes with different number ranges or more attempts.
