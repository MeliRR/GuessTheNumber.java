# Overview

This project is a *Guess the Number** with Java. The game lets the player guess a random number, and it gives feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. There's also a high score tracker that saves the best number of guesses it took to win, so players can try to beat their previous scores.

My main goal with this project was to practice Java and learn more about object-oriented programming, interfaces, and file handling. It was a great way to practice what Iâ€™ve been learning and apply it in a simple project that I could build and run on my own.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used **Visual Studio Code** to write and test the code.

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Libraries**: I used `java.util` for random number generation and `java.io` for file handling (to save the high score). These libraries were pretty helpful to handle basic tasks like generating the random number and reading/writing data to a text file.

# Useful Websites

Here are a few sites that helped me during the project:

- [Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Java Tutorials - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)

# Future Work

There are definitely things I want to improve in the future. Here are a few ideas:

- Add input checks to make sure the player only enters numbers.
- Make a simple graphical interface to make the game more interactive.
- Add a timer to track how fast players can guess the number.
- Let players play multiple rounds in one go, with scores saved between rounds.
- Add different difficulty levels (like more attempts or larger number ranges).
